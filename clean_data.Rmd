## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r filter data}
RNGversion("4.1.0"); set.seed(2870)

crime_data_sample |>
  slice_sample(prop = 0.5)


crime_data_sample |>
  dplyr::select(`Date Rptd`, `DATE OCC`, `TIME OCC`, AREA, `AREA NAME`, `Crm Cd Desc`, `Vict Age`, `Vict Sex`, `Vict Descent`,
                `Premis Desc`, `Weapon Desc`, `Status Desc`, LOCATION, LAT, LON) |>
  rename(
    "date_reported" = `Date Rptd`, 
    "date_occurred" = `DATE OCC`,
    "time_occurred" = `TIME OCC`,
    "area" = AREA,
    "area_name" = `AREA NAME`,
    "crime_description" = `Crm Cd Desc`,
    "victim_age" = `Vict Age`,
    "victim_sex" = `Vict Sex`,
    "victim_descent" = `Vict Descent`,
    "premise_desc" = `Premis Desc`,
    "weapon_desc" = `Weapon Desc`,
    "status" = `Status Desc`,
    "location" = LOCATION,
    "lat" = LAT,
    "long" = LON
  ) |>
  
  mutate(location = str_squish(location)) |>
  
  filter(
    victim_age > 0 & victim_age <= 90,
    !is.na(victim_sex),
    !is.na(victim_descent),
    !is.na(date_reported),
    !is.na(date_occurred),
    !is.na(time_occurred),
    !is.na(area),
    !is.na(area_name),
    !is.na(crime_description),
    !is.na(premise_desc),
    !is.na(victim_age),
    !is.na(status),
    !is.na(location),
    lat != 0 & long != 0,
    !is.na(lat),
    !is.na(long)
  ) |>
  
  slice_sample(prop = .5) ->
  
  crime_data

readr::write_csv(crime_data, "crime_data.csv")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
